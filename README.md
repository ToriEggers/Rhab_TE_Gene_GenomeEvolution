## Comparative Genomics and Phylogenomics of Rhabdiditae Nematodes ###

Project to investigate genome evolution across Rhabdiditae Nematodes plus Pristionchus as outgroup species.

All compute was done between FIU's HPC and SDSC Expanse via ACCESS allocation BIO240239. Due to jumping between systems some of the paths in the scripts may be screwy.
